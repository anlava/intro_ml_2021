# 2021 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analysis 

This is a repo for a 2021 course at the Department of Cosmic Research, MSU. 
The course covers the very basic concepts of ML, it is obligatory for 4th year students, and for MS students it is an elective course.

# General info
- The course consists of 12 lectures and 12 seminars and 5-6 homeworks.
